# Food Multiview Estimator

**Food Multiview Estimator** is a deep learning system that predicts calories and macronutrients (protein, carbohydrates, fat, and weight) from multiple RGB images of a meal — no depth sensors or calibration objects required.

This project combines computer vision, automatic segmentation, and a multiview transformer architecture to perform accurate, real-time nutritional estimation from food photos.

**Title**: *Seeing Through the Plate: Estimating Nutrition from Multiview Food Images*  
**Author**: Andrés Lomelí (Universidad Panamericana, Mexico)  
**Abstract**: This work proposes a lightweight, sensor-free multiview framework for estimating detailed nutritional values from RGB images of meals. The system uses a CNN backbone and a cross-view transformer to infer food volume and composition implicitly through image attention, enabling direct regression of nutritional values.
